## 🚗 Car Insurance Data Analysis

### 📄 Description

This project analyzes a car insurance dataset to gain insights into customer demographics, driving experience, vehicle characteristics, and accident history. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical summaries to identify patterns and correlations in car insurance outcomes.

### 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains 10,000 records with the following features:

* **Customer Information:** `id`, `age`, `gender`, `marital status`, `children`
* **Driving History:** `driving_experience`, `speeding_violations`, `duis`, `past_accidents`
* **Financial Information:** `income`, `credit_score`
* **Vehicle Details:** `vehicle_ownership`, `vehicle_year`, `vehicle_type`, `annual_mileage`
* **Location:** `postal_code`
* **Outcome:** `outcome` (binary variable indicating insurance claim)

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project involves:

1. **Data Cleaning:**

   * Handling missing values
   * Removing duplicate records
2. **Data Transformation:**

   * Renaming columns for better readability
   * Dropping irrelevant columns
3. **Visualization:**

   * Histograms for numerical features
   * Box plots for outlier detection
   * Pair plots for exploring relationships
4. **Statistical Summary:**

   * Descriptive statistics
   * Correlation analysis

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python:** Data manipulation and analysis
* **Pandas:** Data loading and preprocessing
* **NumPy:** Numerical operations
* **Matplotlib:** Data visualization
* **Seaborn:** Advanced visualization

### 📈 Results

* Identified correlations between driving experience and credit score.
* Visualized the distribution of annual mileage and its relationship with insurance claims.
* Analyzed the effect of vehicle type and past accidents on the likelihood of a claim.

### ✨ Future Work

* Implement predictive models to assess the probability of insurance claims.
* Integrate advanced techniques like clustering to segment customers based on risk profiles.
